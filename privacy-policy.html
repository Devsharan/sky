            <p>Our privacy policy is subject to change at any time without notice. To make sure you are aware of any changes, please review this policy periodically.</p>
            <p>By visiting this Website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our Website.</p>
            <p>By mere use of the Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

            <p class="font16-sm pad-t20">1. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and other Information</p>
            <p>When you use our Website, we store your browsing information. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Website to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect personal information from you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. </p>
            <p>In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website. We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.
